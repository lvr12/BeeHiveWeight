# BeeHiveWeight

BeeHiveWeight is a project designed to monitor and record the weight of beehives using IoT technology. The goal is to make beekeeping more data-driven and sustainable by providing beekeepers with real-time and historical insights into hive health and honey production.

## Features

- **Automated Hive Weight Measurement**: Automatically records hive weight using connected sensors.
- **Cloud Data Logging**: Stores measurements securely in the cloud for easy access and remote monitoring.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Visualizes weight trends, alerts for anomalies, and tracks harvest progress.
- **Configurable Notifications**: Alerts beekeepers to sudden weight changes, possible honey harvests, or hive disturbances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi or compatible microcontroller
- Load cell (weight sensor)
- Wi-Fi connectivity
- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lvr12/BeeHiveWeight.git
   cd BeeHiveWeight
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure Hardware**
   - Connect your load cell to the microcontroller.
   - Update configuration files with your sensor pin assignments.

4. **Set Up Cloud Integration**
   - Add your cloud service credentials (e.g., AWS, Google, ThingSpeak) to the config.

5. **Run the Application**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- View live hive weight on the dashboard.
- Set notification thresholds for weight anomalies.
- Export data for analysis.
